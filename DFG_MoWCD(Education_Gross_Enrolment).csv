In 2022-23, 64% of females were found to be employed in agriculture and allied activities.22  A higher proportion of females in rural areas (43%) were also found to be engaged as unpaid helpers in household enterprises.22  In urban areas, women were primarily involved in manufacturing (24%) and services (40%).22
Among women who did not participate in the labour force, 45% did not participate due to childcare/ personal commitment in home making, whereas 34% women wanted to continue their studies.24  Other key factors that may impact female labour force participation are: (i) gender-biased social norms, (ii) salary/wage disparity, and (iii) rising household income acting as a disincentive  for female labour force participation.24  According to a Report (2023) by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, as household incomes rise, women withdraw from labour force and tend to focus on education.24  Following this, as education level rises, women may move back to the labour force.24

Mission SHAKTI aims to address issues that restrict participation of women in the economy. For example, the Palna creche facility under the scheme seeks to address the need of quality creche facilities for children, enabling mothers to take up gainful employment.  The Palna sub-scheme works in conjunction with the Saksham Anganwadi scheme.  According to the guidelines, a Palna creche has to preferably be co-located with the Anganwadi Centre.25
The Ministry of Women and Child Development has set a target of setting up 17,000 Anganwadi-cum- Creches (AWCCs), by 2026.26  As of December 2023, 5,222 AWCCs have been approved.27 According to the Ministry of Women and Child Development, 2,688 creches were operational by May 2023.28  However, the National Creche Scheme dashboard of the Ministry reports a lower number (1,918 AWCCs) as of March 2024.29  These operational creches have 39,128 beneficiaries.30

(v) resistance to change.32

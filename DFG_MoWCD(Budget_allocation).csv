These three schemes are expected to constitute 99% of the Ministry’s total expenditure in 2024-25.

Beneficiaries under the scheme comprise: (i) children up to six years of age, (ii) adolescent girls (14-18 years), and (iii) pregnant women and lactating mothers.6  It also provides for services such as pre-school education and awareness around health and nutrition.  The allocation towards this scheme is estimated to see a decrease of 2% over the revised estimate for the previous year.
12% of the total estimated expenditure of the Ministry in 2024-25 has been allocated towards Mission SHAKTI (Rs 3,146 crore).  Mission SHAKTI aims to address issues of women safety and women empowerment.  It has two components:
(i) Samarthya, which subsumed erstwhile programmes such as creche services, working women hostels, and cash transfers to pregnant and lactating women, and (ii) Sambal, which subsumed erstwhile programmes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Nari Adalat, and Women Helpline.  The allocation towards Mission SHAKTI is estimated to register an increase of 35% over the revised estimate for the previous year.
Mission VATSALYA has been allocated Rs 1,472 crore in 2024-25 (6% of the total allocation towards the Ministry).  This scheme aims to support children in need of care and protection and in conflict with law.  It includes initiatives such as child care institutions, specialised adoption agencies, and sponsorship for foster care.
Fund Utilisation
Utilisation of funds by the Ministry has varied over the years (Figure 1 on next page).  Between 2021- 22 and 2023-24, on average, spending under Mission SHAKTI and Mission VATSALYA was 30% and 19% lower than budgeted (Figure 2 on next page).  The overall fund utilisation by the Ministry was significantly lower in 2019-20 (79%) and 2020-21 (64%).  This was mainly due to underspending under erstwhile Anganwadi services

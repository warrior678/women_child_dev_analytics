There is also a significant inter-state variance in MMR and IMR across regions.  States such as Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha had relatively higher MMR and IMR (see Table 8 in Annexure).
Perinatal deaths (which comprises stillbirths and infant deaths within first seven days of life) offer a better measure of the level of mortality and quality of service around delivery than infant mortality rate which focuses on infant deaths in the first year of life.6  Out of the 32 perinatal deaths in 2020-21, about 20 deaths were early neonatal deaths while 12 deaths were stillbirths (foetal deaths in pregnancies lasting seven or more months).6 Perinatal mortality rate was relatively higher in states such as Uttar Pradesh Bihar, and Jharkhand (for state-wise details, refer to Table 8 in the Annexure).
Poor Child Sex Ratio
According to NFHS-5 (2019-21), child sex ratio (CSR) in India is 928.  This is lower than the natural level of around 950.6,8  CSR is defined as

Immunisation
Universal Immunisation Programme run by the central government offers free vaccines to children against 12 diseases.10  It aims to prevent serious diseases which may have life-threatening consequences.  Over the years, the percentage of fully vaccinated children (referred to as immunisation coverage) has grown, rising from 35% in 1992-93 to 77% between 2019-20 and 2020-21.6  This is still short of universal coverage. Immunisation coverage also varies widely across states.  Most North-eastern states, except Sikkim, have relatively lower coverage, with Nagaland at 58% and others ranging around 60-70%.6  Large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Bihar have coverage near 70% (for details, see table 12 in Annexure).6 Immunisation services for pregnant women and children is one of the components of the Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0 scheme.14
One-third of Anganwadis operate for less than required days, affecting nutrition delivery
As of June 2024, out of about 14 lakh Anganwadi Centres in India, 37% did not operate for a minimum of 25 days in a month (as recommended by the scheme guidelines), while 13% were not open for at least 15 days a month.11  Nutrition support is mainly delivered through two avenues:
(i) hot cooked meals and (ii) take home ration.  Hot cooked meals are provided through AWCs to the beneficiaries for a minimum of 300 days a year, and 25 days a month.12  It also impacts the early childhood care and education and creche facilities offered through the AWC to the beneficiaries.14
Infrastructural deficiencies at Anganwadis
According to the 2012-13 CAG report on Integrated Child Development Services, the AWC has to be consolidated as the first village/habitation post for health, nutrition, and early learning.13  The report also noted that for this to happen, it is imperative that AWCs have their own buildings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2024-25, Rs 26,092 crore has been allocated to the Ministry (0.54% of the union budget).  The allocation towards the Ministry is estimated to increase by 2.5% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  About 99.9% of the Ministry’s expenditure in 2024-25 is revenue expenditure, implying a negligible share of capital expenditure.

Key Expenditure Heads
In 2021-22, the schemes being run by the Ministry were rationalised and replaced with three umbrella schemes (Table 1).  These three schemes are expected to constitute 99% of the Ministry’s total expenditure in 2024-25.  The highest allocation is towards Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0, which aims to combat malnutrition among women and children.  In 2024-25, Rs 21,200 crore has been

Beneficiaries under the scheme comprise: (i) children up to six years of age, (ii) adolescent girls (14-18 years), and (iii) pregnant women and lactating mothers.6  It also provides for services such as pre-school education and awareness around health and nutrition.  The allocation towards this scheme is estimated to see a decrease of 2% over the revised estimate for the previous year.
12% of the total estimated expenditure of the Ministry in 2024-25 has been allocated towards Mission SHAKTI (Rs 3,146 crore).  Mission SHAKTI aims to address issues of women safety and women empowerment.  It has two components:
(i) Samarthya, which subsumed erstwhile programmes such as creche services, working women hostels, and cash transfers to pregnant and lactating women, and (ii) Sambal, which subsumed erstwhile programmes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Nari Adalat, and Women Helpline.  The allocation towards Mission SHAKTI is estimated to register an increase of 35% over the revised estimate for the previous year.
Mission VATSALYA has been allocated Rs 1,472 crore in 2024-25 (6% of the total allocation towards the Ministry).  This scheme aims to support children in need of care and protection and in conflict with law.  It includes initiatives such as child care institutions, specialised adoption agencies, and sponsorship for foster care.
Fund Utilisation
Utilisation of funds by the Ministry has varied over the years (Figure 1 on next page).  Between 2021- 22 and 2023-24, on average, spending under Mission SHAKTI and Mission VATSALYA was 30% and 19% lower than budgeted (Figure 2 on next page).  The overall fund utilisation by the Ministry was significantly lower in 2019-20 (79%) and 2020-21 (64%).  This was mainly due to underspending under erstwhile Anganwadi services

There was also significant variance in gross enrolment across states.  States such as Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Odisha had a relatively lower enrolment in secondary and higher secondary levels (see Table 10 in the Annexure).19  According to the 2018 Survey on Household Social Consumption on Education in India, key reasons for girls dropping out of schools was engagement in domestic activity, marriage, and financial constraints.20
Employment
Low female labour force participation
India has a relatively lower labour force participation rate (LFPR).21  A key reason is low LFPR of females.21  Labour force participation rate (LFPR) is defined as the percentage of persons among those who are working/seeking work in a given age group.22  LFPR among females aged 15 years and above in 2022-23 was 37%, significantly lower than male LFPR at 79%.22  This gap was higher in urban areas where female LFPR stood at 25%, as compared to male LFPR at 75%.22  Female
LFPR in India is below the average of the top 10 economies of the world (55%).23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issues for Consideration
Health and Nutrition
Prevalence of undernutrition among children
Malnutrition is a significant public health concern in India.4  Malnutrition is the deficiency or excesses in nutrient intake.4  According to WHO (2024), women, infants, children, and adolescents are at a higher risk of malnutrition.4  Undernutrition (deficiency in intake) in children makes them more vulnerable to disease and death.4  On several indicators of undernutrition among children, India registered improvements between 2015-16 and 2020-21 (Table 2).6  A joint report on Transforming Child Nutrition by NITI Aayog and UNICEF (2023) termed the progress in the last two decades to be slow.  The National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) estimated that about one- third of children in India are stunted (low height for age).6   About one-third of children in India were also
found to be underweight (low weight for age).  The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"women were also found to be anaemia.6  Anaemia among children can impair cognitive development, stunt growth, and increase morbidity from infectious diseases among children.5  Maternal undernutrition (including anaemia and micronutrient deficiency) increases the risks of stillbirths and infant mortality, while also affecting the mother’s health.4

There is also a significant inter-state variance in MMR and IMR across regions.  States such as Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha had relatively higher MMR and IMR (see Table 8 in Annexure).
Perinatal deaths (which comprises stillbirths and infant deaths within first seven days of life) offer a better measure of the level of mortality and quality of service around delivery than infant mortality rate which focuses on infant deaths in the first year of life.6  Out of the 32 perinatal deaths in 2020-21, about 20 deaths were early neonatal deaths while 12 deaths were stillbirths (foetal deaths in pregnancies lasting seven or more months).6 Perinatal mortality rate was relatively higher in states such as Uttar Pradesh Bihar, and Jharkhand (for state-wise details, refer to Table 8 in the Annexure).
Poor Child Sex Ratio

Immunisation
Universal Immunisation Programme run by the central government offers free vaccines to children against 12 diseases.10  It aims to prevent serious diseases which may have life-threatening consequences.  Over the years, the percentage of fully vaccinated children (referred to as immunisation coverage) has grown, rising from 35% in 1992-93 to 77% between 2019-20 and 2020-21.6  This is still short of universal coverage. Immunisation coverage also varies widely across states.  Most North-eastern states, except Sikkim, have relatively lower coverage, with Nagaland at 58% and others ranging around 60-70%.6  Large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Bihar have coverage near 70% (for details, see table 12 in Annexure).6 Immunisation services for pregnant women and children is one of the components of the Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0 scheme.14
One-third of Anganwadis operate for less than required days, affecting nutrition delivery
As of June 2024, out of about 14 lakh Anganwadi Centres in India, 37% did not operate for a minimum of 25 days in a month (as recommended by the scheme guidelines), while 13% were not open for at least 15 days a month.11  Nutrition support is mainly delivered through two avenues:
(i) hot cooked meals and (ii) take home ration.  Hot cooked meals are provided through AWCs to the beneficiaries for a minimum of 300 days a year, and 25 days a month.12  It also impacts the early childhood care and education and creche facilities offered through the AWC to the beneficiaries.14
Infrastructural deficiencies at Anganwadis
According to the 2012-13 CAG report on Integrated Child Development Services, the AWC has to be consolidated as the first village/habitation post for health, nutrition, and early learning.13  The report also noted that for this to happen, it is imperative that AWCs have their own buildings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"related to women and children. Overview of Finances Allocation in 2024-252
In 2024-25, Rs 26,092 crore has been allocated to the Ministry (0.54% of the union budget).  The allocation towards the Ministry is estimated to increase by 2.5% over the revised estimates of 2023-24.  About 99.9% of the Ministry’s expenditure in 2024-25 is revenue expenditure, implying a negligible share of capital expenditure.

Key Expenditure Heads
In 2021-22, the schemes being run by the Ministry were rationalised and replaced with three umbrella schemes (Table 1).  These three schemes are expected to constitute 99% of the Ministry’s total expenditure in 2024-25.  The highest allocation is towards Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0, which aims to combat malnutrition among women and children.  In 2024-25, Rs 21,200 crore has been

Beneficiaries under the scheme comprise: (i) children up to six years of age, (ii) adolescent girls (14-18 years), and (iii) pregnant women and lactating mothers.6  It also provides for services such as pre-school education and awareness around health and nutrition.  The allocation towards this scheme is estimated to see a decrease of 2% over the revised estimate for the previous year.
12% of the total estimated expenditure of the Ministry in 2024-25 has been allocated towards Mission SHAKTI (Rs 3,146 crore).  Mission SHAKTI aims to address issues of women safety and women empowerment.  It has two components:
(i) Samarthya, which subsumed erstwhile programmes such as creche services, working women hostels, and cash transfers to pregnant and lactating women, and (ii) Sambal, which subsumed erstwhile programmes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Nari Adalat, and Women Helpline.  The allocation towards Mission SHAKTI is estimated to register an increase of 35% over the revised estimate for the previous year.
Mission VATSALYA has been allocated Rs 1,472 crore in 2024-25 (6% of the total allocation towards the Ministry).  This scheme aims to support children in need of care and protection and in conflict with law.  It includes initiatives such as child care institutions, specialised adoption agencies, and sponsorship for foster care.
Fund Utilisation
Utilisation of funds by the Ministry has varied over the years (Figure 1 on next page).  Between 2021- 22 and 2023-24, on average, spending under Mission SHAKTI and Mission VATSALYA was 30% and 19% lower than budgeted (Figure 2 on next page).  The overall fund utilisation by the Ministry was significantly lower in 2019-20 (79%) and 2020-21 (64%).  This was mainly due to underspending under erstwhile Anganwadi services

Low female labour force participation
India has a relatively lower labour force participation rate (LFPR).21  A key reason is low LFPR of females.21  Labour force participation rate (LFPR) is defined as the percentage of persons among those who are working/seeking work in a given age group.22  LFPR among females aged 15 years and above in 2022-23 was 37%, significantly lower than male LFPR at 79%.22  This gap was higher in urban areas where female LFPR stood at 25%, as compared to male LFPR at 75%.22  Female
LFPR in India is below the average of the top 10 economies of the world (55%).23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issues for Consideration
Health and Nutrition
Prevalence of undernutrition among children
Malnutrition is a significant public health concern in India.4  Malnutrition is the deficiency or excesses in nutrient intake.4  According to WHO (2024), women, infants, children, and adolescents are at a higher risk of malnutrition.4  Undernutrition (deficiency in intake) in children makes them more vulnerable to disease and death.4  On several indicators of undernutrition among children, India registered improvements between 2015-16 and 2020-21 (Table 2).6  A joint report on Transforming Child Nutrition by NITI Aayog and UNICEF (2023) termed the progress in the last two decades to be slow.  The National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) estimated that about one- third of children in India are stunted (low height for age).6   About one-third of children in India were also
found to be underweight (low weight for age).  The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"women were also found to be anaemia.6  Anaemia among children can impair cognitive development, stunt growth, and increase morbidity from infectious diseases among children.5  Maternal undernutrition (including anaemia and micronutrient deficiency) increases the risks of stillbirths and infant mortality, while also affecting the mother’s health.4

Increase in anaemia among women and children
As per the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019- 21), prevalence of anaemia among both women and children has increased and remains high.6  Between 2019-20 and 2020-21, about two-thirds of the children aged 6-59 months were found to be anaemic.  About
52% of pregnant women and 57% of non-pregnant",,,

Issues for Consideration
Health and Nutrition
Prevalence of undernutrition among children
Malnutrition is a significant public health concern in India.4  Malnutrition is the deficiency or excesses in nutrient intake.4  According to WHO (2024), women, infants, children, and adolescents are at a higher risk of malnutrition.4  Undernutrition (deficiency in intake) in children makes them more vulnerable to disease and death.4  On several indicators of undernutrition among children, India registered improvements between 2015-16 and 2020-21 (Table 2).6  A joint report on Transforming Child Nutrition by NITI Aayog and UNICEF (2023) termed the progress in the last two decades to be slow.  The National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) estimated that about one- third of children in India are stunted (low height for age).6   About one-third of children in India were also
found to be underweight (low weight for age).  The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"women were also found to be anaemia.6  Anaemia among children can impair cognitive development, stunt growth, and increase morbidity from infectious diseases among children.5  Maternal undernutrition (including anaemia and micronutrient deficiency) increases the risks of stillbirths and infant mortality, while also affecting the mother’s health.4

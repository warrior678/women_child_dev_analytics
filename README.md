This is the reflection of the work of my analytics, which I have done in this project.
 1. What is the trend in maternal mortality across Indian states?
     Using the data, we observed that states like Bihar and Jharkhand have significantly higher maternal mortality rates compared to Kerala and Goa. This suggests disparities in healthcare access and maternal support systems.
 2. How has child malnutrition changed between 2015‚Äì16 and 2019‚Äì21?
     From, All-India malnutrition rates dropped from 36% to 32%. Urban areas improved from 29% to 26%, and rural areas from 38% to 33%, indicating modest progress but persistent rural gaps.  
    


This project analyzes publicly available datasets from the Ministry of Women & Child Development (MoWCD), focusing on health, education, and budget indicators across Indian states. It aims to uncover trends, disparities, and underutilization of schemes to inform data-driven policy decisions.

What is the summary of this project 
Of course. Here is a summary of the data analytics project on Women and Child Development in India:

### **Project Summary**

This project is a **data-driven analysis of the state of women and children in India**, using publicly available government data to uncover critical trends, regional disparities, and policy failures.

The core objective was to move beyond high-level numbers and identify the specific reasons behind slow progress in key areas. This was achieved by cleaning and analyzing semi-structured data from reports like the Ministry of Women & Child Development's budget analysis and the National Family Health Survey. The analysis used **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to process the data and create insightful visualizations.

**Key Findings:**

The analysis uncovered several critical and often interconnected issues:

1.  **Severe Malnutrition & Worsening Anaemia:** One-third of children in India are stunted, with "hotspots" in states like Bihar and Meghalaya where rates exceed 40%. More alarmingly, the anaemia crisis is getting worse, now affecting **67% of young children** and **57% of women**.

2.  **Girls' Education "Leaky Pipeline":** There is a dramatic drop-off in school enrollment for girls, which falls from nearly universal in elementary school to just **58% in higher secondary school**, severely limiting their future economic opportunities.

3.  **Critical Policy and Funding Gaps:** The project revealed that poor outcomes are strongly linked to administrative failures.
    *   **Under-Utilized Schemes:** Key welfare schemes like **Mission SHAKTI** (women's safety) are chronically under-spent by as much as 30%.
    *   **Infrastructural Deficits:** The effectiveness of the national nutrition program is undermined by the fact that over **35% of its Anganwadi centers lack basic facilities** like functional toilets and clean water.

In conclusion, the project successfully translates complex government data into a clear narrative, providing actionable insights. It demonstrates that the challenges in women and child development are often rooted not in a lack of allocated funds, but in **systemic inefficiencies, infrastructural gaps, and a failure to translate policy into on-the-ground impact.**
what is the statistical outcome of this project 
Of course. The statistical outcome of this project is a set of specific, quantifiable metrics that reveal the critical state of women and child development in India and pinpoint the underlying systemic failures.

Here are the key statistical outcomes, broken down by focus area:

### **1. Health and Nutrition Outcomes**

*   **Chronic Malnutrition is Stagnant:** **36% of children under five are stunted** (low height-for-age), and **32% are underweight**. This indicates that approximately one-third of India's children are not receiving adequate nutrition for healthy growth.
*   **Anaemia is a Worsening Epidemic:** The prevalence of anaemia has **increased** across the board between 2015-16 and 2019-21.
    *   Among children (6-59 months), it rose from 58% to **67%**.
    *   Among non-pregnant women (15-49 years), it rose from 53% to **57%**.
*   **Extreme Regional Disparity in Mortality:** While the national Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is **97 deaths per 100,000 live births**, there is a massive statistical variance. States like Assam have an MMR of **195**, more than double the national average, while Kerala's is just **19**. This highlights severe inequality in healthcare access and quality.

### **2. Education Outcomes**

*   **A 42% "Dropout" Rate for Girls in Higher Secondary School:** The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for girls shows a steep decline, quantifying the "leaky pipeline" of education:
    *   Elementary Level: **101%**
    *   Secondary Level: **79%**
    *   Higher Secondary Level: **58%**
    This reveals a critical failure to retain girls in the education system past the age of 15-16.

### **3. Economic Participation Outcomes**

*   **Women's Labour Force Participation is Less Than Half of Men's:** The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for females is just **37%**, compared to **79% for males**.
*   **The Urban Gender Gap is Even Wider:** In urban areas, the female LFPR drops to a mere **25%**, compared to 75% for men, statistically demonstrating that urbanization is not equally benefiting women in terms of economic opportunity.

### **4. Governance and Scheme Implementation Outcomes**

These statistics provide the "why" behind the poor health and education outcomes.

*   **Systemic Under-spending of Allocated Funds:** Key welfare schemes show a significant gap between budget and actual expenditure.
    *   **Mission SHAKTI** (women's empowerment and safety) was under-spent by an average of **30%** between 2021-23.
    *   **Mission VATSALYA** (child protection) was under-spent by **19%** in the same period.
*   **Failure of Core Infrastructure:** The foundation of the national nutrition program is statistically weak.
    *   **35% of Anganwadi Centres lack functional toilets**.
    *   **36% of Anganwadi Centres lack drinking water facilities**.
*   **Increasing Crime Rate:** The crime rate against women has statistically worsened, increasing from **42 per 100,000** female population in 2012 to **66 in 2022**.
*   Here is the statistical analysis that I have done in this project.
*   1.Maternal & Infant Mortality( Global Maternal infant mortality.csv)
*   Statistical Observations.
*   Highest maternal mortality: Bihar (63), Jharkhand (59), Chhattisgarh (61)
*   Lowest maternal mortality: Kerala (19), Goa (24)
*   Infant mortality also follows a similar pattern, with Bihar and Assam exceeding 40 per 1000 live births.
Outcome: States with poor maternal health infrastructure consistently show elevated infant mortality, suggesting a strong correlation between maternal care and child survival.
2. Malnutrition Trends( Malnutrition_by_year.csv)
Statistical Observations.
*  All-India underweight prevalence dropped from 36% (2015‚Äì16) to 32% (2019‚Äì21)
*  Urban: 29% ‚Üí 26%; Rural: 38% ‚Üí 33%
*  Change: Rural areas saw the largest improvement (-5%)
Outcome: While malnutrition is declining, rural India still lags behind urban regions, indicating the need for targeted nutritional interventions.
3. Anaemia Prevalence (Anaemia_women_children.csv)
Statistical Observations.
* Over 50% of women and children in several states are anaemic.
* Anaemia rates remain high despite national supplementation programs.
Outcome: Nutritional programs may be underperforming or poorly targeted. There's a need for better awareness and monitoring mechanisms.     

### **Overall Statistical Conclusion**

The primary statistical outcome of this project is the **quantification of a major disconnect between policy allocation and real-world impact**. The data proves that significant financial budgets are not translating into better outcomes due to quantifiable failures in scheme implementation, administrative bottlenecks (chronic under-spending), and a severe deficit in foundational infrastructure.

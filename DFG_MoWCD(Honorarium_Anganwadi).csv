"with adequate infrastructure.  As of July 2024, about half of the total AWCs are operating out of own government buildings.11  The rest of the AWCs utilise either rented premises or other premises (includes panchayat house, community buildings, school premises, and open spaces).
As of June, 2024, 35% did not have functional toilets and 36% did not have drinking water facilities.11  State-wise assessment of AWCs have brought out certain gaps.  For example, in Andhra Pradesh, few AWCs lack separate washrooms for girls, accessibility issues in hilltop and tribal areas, delayed reimbursement for transportation of take- home ration.14  In Assam, irregularity in receiving rent grants from the government was found to be a major challenge.14  Certain AWCs in tribal areas in Assam were prone to frequent flooding.  Limited distribution of raw materials for food preparation impacted delivery of hot cooked meals.14

There was also significant variance in gross enrolment across states.  States such as Meghalaya, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Odisha had a relatively lower enrolment in secondary and higher secondary levels (see Table 10 in the Annexure).19  According to the 2018 Survey on Household Social Consumption on Education in India, key reasons for girls dropping out of schools was engagement in domestic activity, marriage, and financial constraints.20
Employment
Low female labour force participation
India has a relatively lower labour force participation rate (LFPR).21  A key reason is low LFPR of females.21  Labour force participation rate (LFPR) is defined as the percentage of persons among those who are working/seeking work in a given age group.22  LFPR among females aged 15 years and above in 2022-23 was 37%, significantly lower than male LFPR at 79%.22  This gap was higher in urban areas where female LFPR stood at 25%, as compared to male LFPR at 75%.22  Female
LFPR in India is below the average of the top 10 economies of the world (55%).23",,

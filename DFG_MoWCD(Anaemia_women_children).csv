"Mortality rates among mothers and children
Service delivery for maternal care has improved in both urban and rural India over the last few years. Institutional births constitute 89% of all births in India, whereas around 90% of all births are attended by skilled health personnel.6
Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) defined as the number of maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births has declined between 2014 and 2020.6  In addition, infant mortality rate (IMR) has also come down during the same period.  IMR is the number of deaths in the first year of life per 1,000 live births. MMR and IMR in India is significantly higher than countries such as USA, China, Germany, and UK
(see Table 9 in Annexure).7","Fund (2019), reasons for a lower child sex ratio in India include: (i) economic and social considerations motivating preference for a son such as concerns for old-age security, dowry and wedding expenses, rising financial costs and relative financial costs of raising daughters, and (ii) sex-selection.9

There is also a significant inter-state variance in MMR and IMR across regions.  States such as Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha had relatively higher MMR and IMR (see Table 8 in Annexure).
Perinatal deaths (which comprises stillbirths and infant deaths within first seven days of life) offer a better measure of the level of mortality and quality of service around delivery than infant mortality rate which focuses on infant deaths in the first year of life.6  Out of the 32 perinatal deaths in 2020-21, about 20 deaths were early neonatal deaths while 12 deaths were stillbirths (foetal deaths in pregnancies lasting seven or more months).6 Perinatal mortality rate was relatively higher in states such as Uttar Pradesh Bihar, and Jharkhand (for state-wise details, refer to Table 8 in the Annexure).
Poor Child Sex Ratio
According to NFHS-5 (2019-21), child sex ratio (CSR) in India is 928.  This is lower than the natural level of around 950.6,8  CSR is defined as
the number of females per 1,000 males in the age 0-6 years.6  As per the United Nations Population","2015-16                                 2019-21

Immunisation
Universal Immunisation Programme run by the central government offers free vaccines to children against 12 diseases.10  It aims to prevent serious diseases which may have life-threatening consequences.  Over the years, the percentage of fully vaccinated children (referred to as immunisation coverage) has grown, rising from 35% in 1992-93 to 77% between 2019-20 and 2020-21.6  This is still short of universal coverage. Immunisation coverage also varies widely across states.  Most North-eastern states, except Sikkim, have relatively lower coverage, with Nagaland at 58% and others ranging around 60-70%.6  Large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Bihar have coverage near 70% (for details, see table 12 in Annexure).6 Immunisation services for pregnant women and children is one of the components of the Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0 scheme.14
One-third of Anganwadis operate for less than required days, affecting nutrition delivery
As of June 2024, out of about 14 lakh Anganwadi Centres in India, 37% did not operate for a minimum of 25 days in a month (as recommended by the scheme guidelines), while 13% were not open for at least 15 days a month.11  Nutrition support is mainly delivered through two avenues:
(i) hot cooked meals and (ii) take home ration.  Hot cooked meals are provided through AWCs to the beneficiaries for a minimum of 300 days a year, and 25 days a month.12  It also impacts the early childhood care and education and creche facilities offered through the AWC to the beneficiaries.14
Infrastructural deficiencies at Anganwadis
According to the 2012-13 CAG report on Integrated Child Development Services, the AWC has to be consolidated as the first village/habitation post for health, nutrition, and early learning.13  The report also noted that for this to happen, it is imperative that AWCs have their own buildings"
